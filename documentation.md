# **Backend Documentation**

## **Overview**

This documentation provides detailed insights into the backend structure and functionalities of the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack application deployed on Azure.

## Application Setup

1. Clone project
2. Install packanges with 
3. Populate `.env` folder
    
    ```
    HTTP_PORT = 
    TOKEN_SECRET = 
    USER = 
    SERVICE = 
    BASE_URL = 
    OAUTH_CLIENTID = 
    OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET = 
    OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN = 
    OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN = 
    MONGO_URI = 
    AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_STORAGE_STRING = 
    ```
    
4. Start application with `npm run start:dev`

## **Application Structure**

The backend of the application is organized into five main parts:

1. **Authentication**: Manages user authentication and authorization.
2. **Agenda**: Handles agenda-related operations and data management.
3. **Session**: Manages session-related functionalities.
4. **Socket**: Supports real-time communication features.
5. **Vote**: Manages voting-related functionalities.

Each part consists of its own model, API routes, and controller functions to facilitate efficient retrieval and manipulation of data from the database.

## **Route Functionality**

### **APIs and Controllers**

- **Index.js**: Located inside the **`apis`** folder, it defines all the routes for the application.
- **API Functions**: Defined in files within the **`api`** folder, these functions are called upon endpoint requests. They primarily focus on data destructuring received from the frontend and invoking corresponding controller functions for database operations.

### **Authentication Functionality**

- The authentication functionality includes:
    - SignUp
    - SignIn
    - JWT Token Provisioning

### **User Roles**

- Users can have three different roles:
    - Client
    - Admin
    - Super-admin
- Admin permissions include accessing the protected **`/admin`** route to manipulate agendas and sessions. Super-admins have extended access, including user information manipulation on route `/super-admin`.

## **Models and CRUD Operations**

- **Agenda and Session Models**: Each model includes CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation functions.
- **Session-Agenda Relationship**: Sessions and agendas are connected through IDs. Each session contains a property named **`agendas`**, representing a list of agenda IDs belonging to that session.
- **Agenda-Specific Logic**:
    - When retrieving all sessions, additional logic ensures that the **`agendas`** property provides entire agenda objects related to the IDs.
        - Additional logic for getting all sessions with agendas provide whole agenda object inside session property `agendas` instead just list of agenda ids
    - Deleting an agenda removes its ID from the session object.
    - Deleting a session removes all agendas belonging to that session.

## **Conclusion**

This documentation outlines the backend architecture, route functionality, authentication processes, user roles, and models with CRUD operations for the MERN stack application. It serves as a comprehensive guide for developers and administrators working with the backend of the application.

## Application Setup

1. Clone project
2. Install packanges with 
3. Start application with `npm start`
4. If you want to start with local backend you need to change url inside `axios` file

# **Frontend Documentation**

## **Overview**

This documentation provides a user-friendly guide to navigating and utilizing the frontend of the application, built with React and styled using Material UI. The frontend facilitates seamless interaction with the application's features and functionalities.

## **Routes**

The frontend consists of four main routes:

- **`/`**: Login page for user authentication.
- **`/main`**: Main page displaying sessions, agendas, and voting results.
- **`/tv`**: Live preview of current agenda voting, designed for spectator viewing.
- **/admin**: Admin panel for CRUD operations on agendas and sessions.
- **`/super-admin`**: Super-admin panel for CRUD operations on user data.

## **Main Page**

The main page is divided into three main parts:

1. **Left Part**:
    - Top section: Burger menu for session selection, user name display, and admin/super-admin access buttons.
    - Bottom section: List of agendas. Clicking on an agenda selects it. Agendas marked as "locked" indicate that voting has concluded.
2. **Middle Part**:
    - Representation of the agenda document as a PDF.
3. **Right Part**:
    - Voting preview:
        - Users are categorized by parties.
        - Each user's vote status is indicated with colors and explained alongside the agenda.

## **TV Page**

The TV page provides a live preview of the ongoing voting agenda:

- Similar to the main page, users are divided by parties.
- Visitors can view the voting status of each user in real-time.
- Visitors on top of page can see results

## **Admin Panel**

The admin panel allows authorized users to perform CRUD operations on agendas and sessions:

- Create, read, update, and delete operations are supported.
- Deleting a session removes all associated agendas.
- Possibility to upload pdf.

## **Super-admin Panel**

The super-admin panel offers similar functionalities as the admin panel but focuses on user data manipulation:

- CRUD operations on user data, including creation, modification, and deletion.

## **Conclusion**

This documentation serves as a user-friendly guide for navigating and utilizing the frontend of the application. It provides clear instructions on accessing different routes, understanding the main page layout, utilizing the TV page for live voting previews, and efficiently managing agendas, sessions, and user data through the admin and super-admin panels.

# Frontend Technical Logic

## Router file

The router file manages the routing functionality of the application, directing users to different pages based on their authentication status and role. Here's an overview of how the router works:

### **Functionality Overview:**

- The router utilizes the **`BrowserRouter`** component from React Router for declarative routing.
- It defines routes for different pages of the application using the **`Route`** component.
- Based on the user's authentication status and role, the router redirects them to appropriate pages or displays a login page if necessary.

### **Code Breakdown:**

- **Authentication Check**:
    - The **`isLoggedIn`** variable, obtained from the **`useAuth`** hook, checks if the user is logged in.
    - The **`role`** variable retrieves the user's role from the local storage.
- **Route Definitions**:
    - The router defines routes for the login page, main page, TV screen, admin panel, and super-admin panel.
    - Conditional rendering is used to ensure that users are redirected to the appropriate pages based on their authentication status and role.
- **Conditional Rendering**:
    - If the user is not logged in (**`!isLoggedIn`**), they are redirected to the login page (**`<LoginScene />`**).
    - If the user is logged in, they are redirected to the main page (**`<MainScene />`**) unless they access the root URL, in which case they are redirected to the main page.
    - Access to the admin panel (**`<Admin />`**) and super-admin panel (**`<SuperAdmin />`**) is restricted based on the user's role. Only users with the "admin" or "super-admin" role can access these pages.
- **Navigation**:
    - The **`<Navigate>`** component from React Router is used to programmatically navigate users to different pages.

## Main screen

The **`MainScene`** component serves as the main interface for the voting application. It allows users to view agendas, participate in votes, and view voting statistics in real-time. This component interacts with backend services through websockets to fetch agenda data, handle voting events, and update voting results dynamically.
